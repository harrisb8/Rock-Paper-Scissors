# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This a small project to recreate the classic game rock paper scissors

Just fresh out of boot camp, I wanted to pick a small project to work on my JavaScript bascis. The user will play against the computer in Rock Paper Scissors by clicking on an icon to make their selection. After the user clicks on their choice they will be inform whether they beat the computer who will randomly make a choice. The screen will then display wether the user or the computer won that match. This will be a contest that is best out of 5. 

Going into the project I am excited because of the growth I will gain through the process.
